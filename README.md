**proof of concept for artificial selection in a gene pool of asexually reproducing trees.**

When I read Dawkins' The Greatest Show On Earth as a kid I found the idea of rudimentary trees mutating and having traits selected for on a computer screen fascinating. Fun little weekend project, very rough around the edges but it gets the idea right. 

Currently all children in a generation are mutated clones of the selected parent from the previous generation, "mimicing" asexual reproduction. Will maybe implement 2-parent sexual reproduction in a future iteration, with recessive and dominant genes.
