**simulated artificial selection of sexually reproducing rudimentary trees.**

when I read Dawkins' The Greatest Show On Earth as a kid I found the idea of simple trees mutating and having traits selected for on a computer screen fascinating, so I wanted to have a go at it myself now that I know my way around code.

Timeline:

10/09: currently all children in a generation are mutated clones of the selected parent, "mimicing" asexual reproduction. Will maybe implement 2-parent reproduction in a future iteration, with recessive and dominant genes.

11/09: mutation function highly unstable, trying to fix sudden explosions.

12/09: mutation now completely stable, added automatic selection for multiple attributes (except color), fixed exploding mutations with help of a lot of calculation (my laptop will never physically recover from this). also it doesn't crash now.

04/11: sexual reproduction implemented with OOP this time as opposed to the incomprehensible dict-list nightmare that was the asexual one. Project mostly complete save for visualizing the population.
