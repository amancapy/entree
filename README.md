**artificial selection in a gene pool of asexually reproducing trees.**

when I read Dawkins' The Greatest Show On Earth as a kid I found the idea of rudimentary trees mutating and having traits selected for on a computer screen fascinating. Fun little weekend project, very rough around the edges but it gets the idea right. crashes occassionally into the 100s of generations, but I just wanted to see if I could implement the concept.

currently all children in a generation are mutated clones of the selected parent, "mimicing" asexual reproduction. Will maybe implement 2-parent sexual reproduction in a future iteration, with recessive and dominant genes.

11/09: mutation function highly unstable, trying to fix sudden explosions.
